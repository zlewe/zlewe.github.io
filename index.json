Teams in SubT Challenge mostly go with the deployable communication approach. Team NCTU also deploy communication nodes of our own design which are capable of mesh networking. One of the problem faced is when and how should we deploy a new node.\nPlease download the PDF file for more details.\n","date":1596527350,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1596527350,"objectID":"d5172fc3b16812c32fead8ec9bfeb1ed","permalink":"https://zlewe.github.io/project/xbee-network-mobile-robot-exploration/","publishdate":"2020-08-04T15:49:10+08:00","relpermalink":"/project/xbee-network-mobile-robot-exploration/","section":"project","summary":"Spring 2020 Undergraduate Project in NCTU","tags":["mobile-robot","robotics","communication","mesh","xbee"],"title":"Xbee Wireless Mesh Network and Communication-aware Planning in Mobile Robot Exploration","type":"project"},{"authors":["Zu Lin Ewe"],"categories":[],"content":"Undergraduate Project  Semester: Fall 2019 Advisor:  Prof. Hsueh-Cheng ‘Nick’ Wang  Assistant Professor  Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering,  National Chiao Tung University Prof. Wen-Chih Peng  Chairman/Professor  Department of Computer Science,  National Chiao Tung University    Abstract In the recent years, ultra-wideband based (UWB) system has become increasingly popular for positioning especially in GPS-denied environments such as indoors. This is due to the unique RF characteristic of UWB where accurate range measurements can be obtained with time of arrival (ToA) method. This project seek to analyse the system as well as exploring its possible applications in DARPA Sub-terranean Challenge, where mobile robots are deployed into unknown environments for exploration.\nPlease download the PDF file for more details.\n","date":1583305265,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1583305265,"objectID":"79d9a9af5ee4d1cedd0c1469d143cfb9","permalink":"https://zlewe.github.io/project/uwb-based-positioning-system/","publishdate":"2020-03-04T15:01:05+08:00","relpermalink":"/project/uwb-based-positioning-system/","section":"project","summary":"Fall 2019 Undergraduate Project in NCTU","tags":["robotics","positioning","localization","ultra-wideband"],"title":"Uwb-based Positioning System Analysis and Applications in Mobile Robot Exploration","type":"project"},{"authors":["Zu Lin Ewe"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1561910726,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1561910726,"objectID":"3831a2fa9e44076ca9b7c4ce2359e9ac","permalink":"https://zlewe.github.io/project/statistical-diagram-classification/","publishdate":"2019-07-01T00:05:26+08:00","relpermalink":"/project/statistical-diagram-classification/","section":"project","summary":"Python web app using Flask for Statistical Diagram Classification using CNN","tags":["Deep Learning","Python","Convolutional Neural Network"],"title":"Statistical Diagram Classification","type":"project"}]
